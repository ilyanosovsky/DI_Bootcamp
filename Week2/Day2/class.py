# Exercise 9 : Random Number
# Instructions
# Ask the user to input a number from 1 to 9 (including).
# Get a random number between 1 and 9. Hint: random module.
# use a loop that allows the user to keep guessing until they want to quit.
# on exiting the loop tally up and display total games won and lost.

import random
winners = 0
losers = 0
number = input("Write any number from 1 to 9: ")
random_number = random.randrange(1, 10)
while number != "quit":
    if int(number) == random_number :
        print("Your guess is correct, You are the Winner")
        winners += 1
    else:
        print(f"Better luck next time, number was: {random_number}")
        losers += 1
    number = input("Write any number from 1 to 9: ")
    random_number = random.randrange(1, 10)
print(f"Total games won: {winners}")
print(f"Total games lost: {losers}")









# If the user guesses the correct number print a message that says Winner.
# If the user guesses the wrong number print a message that says better luck next time.
# Bonus 2: on exiting the loop tally up and display total games won and lost.
