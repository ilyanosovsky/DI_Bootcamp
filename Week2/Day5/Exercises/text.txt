What should i do at the beginning? 

1. Display the board. 
    1) Draw a board by symbols 
    2) 3 squers by 3 squers 
    3) we should put it in a function called display_board()
    4) this function will show yhe board every time you play 
    5) Board can be a List with 3 rows and 3 columns 

2.  To get the position from the player.
    1) We have 2 players. First for X, Second for O 
    2) We need a function player_input(player) to get ROW and COLUMN from Player 
    3) We will get Indexes [0][0] - to put mark in specific place 


display_board()

print stars
loop on the board 
print strs

----> print board 

player_input(player)


--> check that user doesnt input a place that is already take 
--> check that row and column are in in the range of the board 

-> if already taken or wrong number : ask again -> while loop 

--> only when its OK append it inside board 


board = [
    ["", "X", ""],
    ["", "", ""],
    ["", "", ""]
]

--> display board again 

----> determine which turn is it 
1 - maximum turn is 9 --> while loop until 9 / for loop range 9
2 - turn is odd --> X if the turn is 1 --> X
3 - turn is even --> O if the turn is 2 --> O 

----> input row and column 
row : 1 
col : 2 

display it on the board 


check_win() 

in every turn you need to check
