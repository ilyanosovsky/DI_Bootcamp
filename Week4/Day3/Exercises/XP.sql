-- Exercise 1: DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Get a list of all film languages.
-- SELECT name FROM language

-- Get a list of all films joined with their languages – select the following details : 
-- film title, description, and language name. Try your query with different joins:
-- SELECT title, description, name 
-- FROM film
-- INNER JOIN language ON film.language_id = language.language_id



-- Get all films, even if they don’t have languages.
-- SELECT title, description, name 
-- FROM film
-- LEFT JOIN language ON film.language_id = language.language_id



-- Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages.
-- SELECT title, description, name 
-- FROM film
-- RIGHT JOIN language ON film.language_id = language.language_id



-- Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.
-- CREATE TABLE new_film (
-- 	film_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
-- 	title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
-- );

-- INSERT INTO new_film (title)
-- VALUES
-- ('Tron'),
-- ('TED'),
-- ('Spider-Man'),
-- ('Interstellar');



-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id – a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id – references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id – references the language table. What language the review is in.
-- title – the title of the review.
-- score – the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text – the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update – when the review was last updated.


-- CREATE TABLE customer_review (
-- 	review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
-- 	film_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
-- 	language_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
-- 	title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
-- 	score INTEGER NOT NULL,
-- 	review_text TEXT,
-- 	last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp,
-- 	CONSTRAINT fk_film_id FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES new_film(film_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
-- 	CONSTRAINT fk_language_id FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id), 
-- 	CONSTRAINT score_value CHECK (score > 0 AND score <= 10)
-- )

-- Add 2 movie reviews. Make sure you link them to valid objects in the other tables.
-- INSERT INTO customer_review (film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text)
-- VALUES
-- (1, 1, 'Great movie', 6, 'Norm film. Bla bla bla bla' ),
-- (2, 1, 'Excellent movie', 8, 'It is very funny film') RETURNING *

-- Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?
-- DELETE FROM new_film WHERE (title='Tron') RETURNING *

-- SELECT * FROM new_film
-- SELECT * FROM customer_review



-- Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.
-- UPDATE film  SET language_id = 2 WHERE (film_id = 133)



-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?
-- INSERT INTO customer (first_name, last_name, store_id, address_id)
-- VALUES ('Ben', 'Smith', 1, 2) 
-- SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'Ben'


-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?
-- DROP TABLE customer_review


-- Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet).
-- SELECT * FROM rental WHERE (return_date IS NULL)




-- Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet)
-- SELECT inventory.film_id, film.title, film.replacement_cost FROM inventory INNER JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id

-- SELECT * FROM rental 
-- INNER JOIN inventory ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
-- LEFT JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
-- WHERE rental.return_date IS NULL
-- ORDER BY film.replacement_cost DESC LIMIT 30


-- Your friend is at the store, and decides to rent a movie. He knows he wants to see 4 movies, but he can’t remember their names.
-- Can you help him find which movies he wants to rent?
-- The 1st film : The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.

-- SELECT * FROM actor 
-- WHERE (first_name = 'Penelope' AND last_name = 'Monroe')

-- SELECT film.film_id, film.title, film.fulltext FROM film_actor 
-- INNER JOIN film ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
-- WHERE (actor_id = (SELECT actor_id FROM actor WHERE (first_name = 'Penelope' AND last_name = 'Monroe')))
-- AND film.fulltext @@ to_tsquery ('english', 'sumo') 



-- The 2nd film : A short documentary (less than 1 hour long), rated “R”.
-- SELECT * FROM film 
-- INNER JOIN film_category ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
-- INNER JOIN category ON category.category_id = film_category.category_id
-- WHERE length < 60 AND rating = 'R' AND category.name = 'Documentary'




-- The 3rd film : A film that his friend Matthew Mahan rented. He paid over $4.00 for the rental, and he returned it between the 28th of July and the 1st of August, 2005.
-- SELECT * FROM inventory
-- INNER JOIN film ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
-- INNER JOIN rental ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
-- INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
-- WHERE customer.first_name = 'Matthew'
-- AND customer.last_name = 'Mahan'
-- AND film.rental_rate > 4
-- AND rental.return_date > '2005-07-28'
-- AND rental.return_date < '2005-08-01'




-- The 4th film : His friend Matthew Mahan watched this film, as well. It had the word “boat” in the title or description, and it looked like it was a very expensive DVD to replace.
-- SELECT * FROM inventory
-- INNER JOIN film ON film.film_id = inventory.film_id
-- INNER JOIN rental ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
-- INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
-- WHERE customer.first_name = 'Matthew'
-- AND customer.last_name = 'Mahan'
-- AND (film.title ILIKE '%boat%' OR film.description ILIKE '%boat%')
-- ORDER BY film.replacement_cost DESC LIMIT 1
