# Instructions : Old MacDonald’s Farm
# Take a look at the following code and output:
# File: market.py

# macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
# macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
# print(macdonald.get_info())
# Output

# cow : 5
# sheep : 2
# goat : 12

#     E-I-E-I-0!


# Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

# Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
# Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
# How many methods does the Farm class need?
# Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
# Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
# Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.

class Farm:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.animals = {}

    def add_animal(self, animal, amount = 1):
        if animal in self.animals:
            self.animals[animal] += amount
        else:
            self.animals[animal] = amount

    def get_info(self):
        info = f"{self.name}'s farm\n"
        for animal, amount in self.animals.items():
            info += f"{animal} : {amount}\n"
        info += "E-I-E-I-0!"
        return info
