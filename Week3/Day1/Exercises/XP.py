# Exercise 1: Cats
# Instructions
# Using this class

class Cat:
    def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
        self.name = cat_name
        self.age = cat_age

# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
# Print the following string: “The oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.”. Use the function previously created.

cat1 = Cat("Tom", 1)
cat2 = Cat("John", 3)
cat3 = Cat("Jerry", 5)



def oldest_cat(*args):
    oldest = args[0]
    for cat in args:
        if cat.age > oldest.age:
            oldest = cat
    return oldest

oldest = oldest_cat(cat1, cat2, cat3)
print(f"The oldest cat is {oldest.name}, and is {oldest.age} years old.")


# Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height
    
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} goes woof!")
    
    def jump(self):
        print(f"{self.name} jumps {self.height*2} cm high!")

davids_dog = Dog("Rex", 50)
sarahs_dog = Dog("Teacup", 20)

davids_dog.bark()
davids_dog.jump()

sarahs_dog.bark()
sarahs_dog.jump()

if davids_dog.height > sarahs_dog.height:
    print(f"{davids_dog.name} is bigger")
else:
    print(f"{sarahs_dog.name} is bigger")


# Exercise 3 : Who’s The Song Producer?
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["There’s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There’s a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and she’s buying a stairway to heaven

class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics
    
    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for line in self.lyrics:
            print(line)

stairway= Song(["There's a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she's buying a stairway to heaven"])
stairway.sing_me_a_song()

# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn’t already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.


class Zoo:
    def __init__(self, zoo_name):
        self.animals = []
        self.name = zoo_name

    def add_animal(self, new_animal):
        if new_animal not in self.animals:
            self.animals.append(new_animal)

    def sell_animal(self, animal_sold):
        if animal_sold in self.animals:
            self.animals.remove(animal_sold)

# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example

# { 
#     1: "Ape",
#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
