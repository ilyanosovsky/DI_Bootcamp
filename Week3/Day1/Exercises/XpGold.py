# Exercise 1 : Geometry
# Instructions
# Write a class called Circle that receives a radius as an argument (default is 1.0).
# Write two instance methods to compute perimeter and area.
# Write a method that prints the geometrical definition of a circle.

class Circle:
    def __init__ (self, radius = 1.0):
        self.radius = radius
