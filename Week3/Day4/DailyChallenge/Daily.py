# with open((dir_path+"\\the_stranger.txt"), "r") as text:
#      print(text.read())


# Instructions :
# The goal of the exercise is to create a class that will help you analyze a specific text. 
# A text can be just a simple string, like “Today, is a happy day” or it can be an external text file.

# Part I
# First, we will analyze a simple string, like “A good book would sometimes cost as much as a good house.”

# Create a class called Text that takes a string as an argument and store the text in a attribute.
# Hint: You need to manually copy-paste the text, straight into the code

class Text:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text

# Implement the following methods:
# a method to return the frequency of a word in the text (assume words are separated by whitespace) return None or a meaningful message.
# a method that returns the most common word in the text.
# a method that returns a list of all the unique words in the text.

    def frequency(self, word):
        print(f"The word {word} appears {self.text.count(word)} times in the text.")
        return self.text.count(word)
    
    def most_common(self):
        words = self.text.split()
        most_common = ""
        for word in words:
            if words.count(word) > words.count(most_common):
                most_common = word
        print(f"The most common word is {most_common}.")
        return most_common
    
    def unique_words(self):
        words = self.text.split()
        unique_words = []
        for word in words:
            if word not in unique_words:
                unique_words.append(word)
        print(f"The unique words are {unique_words}.")
        return unique_words
    
# Part II
# Then, we will analyze a text coming from an external text file. Download the_stranger.txt file.

# Implement a classmethod that returns a Text instance but with a text file:

#     >>> Text.from_file('the_stranger.txt')
# Hint: You need to open and read the text from the text file.
# Now, use the provided the_stranger.txt file and try using the class you created above.


    @classmethod
    def from_file(cls, file):
        with open(file, "r") as f:
            text = f.read()
        return cls(text)
    

text = Text.from_file("/Users/ilyanosovsky/Documents/Developers_institute/DI_Bootcamp/Week3/Day4/DailyChallenge/the_stranger.txt")


# Bonus:
# Create a class called TextModification that inherits from Text.

# Implement the following methods:
# a method that returns the text without any punctuation.
# a method that returns the text without any english stop-words (check out what this is !!).
# a method that returns the text without any special characters.
# Note: Feel free to implement/create any attribute, method or function needed to make this work, be creative :)

class TextModification(Text):
    def __init__(self, text):
        super().__init__(text)

    def remove_punctuation(self):
        punctuation = '''!;:,.?'''
        for char in self.text:
            if char in punctuation:
                self.text = self.text.replace(char, "")
        print(self.text)
        return self.text
    
    def remove_stop_words(self):
        with open("/Users/ilyanosovsky/Documents/Developers_institute/DI_Bootcamp/Week3/Day4/DailyChallenge/stop_words.txt", "r") as f:
            stop_words = f.read().split()
        words = self.text.split()
        for word in words:
            if word in stop_words:
                words.remove(word)
        self.text = " ".join(words)
        print(self.text)
        return self.text
    
    def remove_special_characters(self):
        special_characters = '''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''
        for char in self.text:
            if char in special_characters:
                self.text = self.text.replace(char, "")
        print(self.text)
        return self.text
    
text = TextModification.from_file("/Users/ilyanosovsky/Documents/Developers_institute/DI_Bootcamp/Week3/Day4/DailyChallenge/the_stranger.txt")
text.remove_punctuation()
text.remove_stop_words()
text.remove_special_characters()





# text = Text("A good book would sometimes cost as much as a good house.")
